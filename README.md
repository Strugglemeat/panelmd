panel de pon for mega drive - SGDK 1.62 / 1.65

***todo:***

check Hori+Vert matches after gravity

===========

vscroll to raise stack rather than pop up a new row of tiles - smoother

===========

option for 320 wide or 256 wide

===========

convert falling pieces to sprites so they can fall 1px at a time

===========

in gravity, each piece hangs in the air for a little while, then falls
